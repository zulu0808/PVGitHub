# Homework Assignment #1

## Online Personal Finance, based in San Francisco, CA.

* Social Finance, Inc. (SoFi, https://www.sofi.com/)

* Founded in August 2011.

## Founders
* Michael Cagney (2011-2017)
* Dan Macklin (2011-2017)
* James Finnigan (2011-2015)
* Ian Brady (2011-2013)

* The original founders met at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Their objective was to provide more affordable educational loans to prospective college students, Stanford in particular. The original effort was conducted within the Stanford University system, matching up alumni investors with qualified students.

* Original funding came from a group of forty Stanford alumni who contributed $2 million to a pilot program at Stanford itself. Those funds provided loans to one hundred students. Since inception, SoFi's has raised capital through private equity and venture capital in the following timeline:
    * 2011: $2 million 
    * 2012: $77.2 million
    * 2013: $500 million
    * 2014: $80 million
    * 2015: $200 million
    * 2017: $500 million
    * 2019 $500 million

## Business Activities:

* SoFi's original mission was to offer lower fixed-rate loans to students, but has since expanded to various aspects of lending, both personal and commercial. 

* The original target market was college students seeking educational loans. As of June 2019, the student debt market represented $1.6 trillion (https://www.usnews.com/news/elections/articles/2019-11-01/student-debt-explained-breaking-down-the-16t-in-loans). 
Sofi's advantage (not necessarily unfair) is the vast scope of their business. They offer multiple platforms that their competitors, cannot match in size and scale.

* According to G2 Stack (https://stack.g2.com/company/sofi), Sofi uses the following products among others:
    * Product & Design: Adobe Typekit, Font Awesome, Google Fonts and Wrike.
    * Developers: Adobe Flash, Bootstrap, HTML5, Modernizr, PHP, Plyfill, Raven.js and jQuery.
    * Analytics & Data Science: Branch Metrics, Google Analytics, Optimizely and iSpot.tv.
    * Devops and IT: Cloudflare, Deis, Facebook Comments, LogicGate, New Relic, RebelMouse, Rollbar, Symantec SSl, Vimeo, WordPress, eOriginal, nginx and vzaar.
    * Marketing: Adroll, AddToAny, Ambassador, Contently, Flite, Google Tag Manager, Outbrain, Salesforce Pardot, ShareThis, The Trade Desk, Twilio SendGrid, Unbounce, dotmailer and mParticle.
    * Productivity & Operations: Appoinlet, G Suite, Google Drive, Microsoft Office 365 and ValiMail.
    * HR: Jobvite, Talentoday and Workify.
    * Customer Support & Success: ForeSee and Vanilla Forums.
    * Finance & Accounting: Expensify and Monexa.
    * Sales & BD: NetSuite CRM+.

## Landscape:

* As part of its online financial platform Sofi offers multiple services (https://www.sofi.com/):
    * Borrowing: Private student loans, student loan refinancing, personal and home loans.
    * Sofi Invest: Active or automated investing, retirement accounts, Crypto, Stock Bits (fractional shares trading), ETF's and cash management through Sofi Money.
    * Sofi Protect (Insurance): Renters, homeowners, auto and life.
    * Sofi at Work (Small business financing) .

* The major trend in this space has been the transformation of a single product financial institution  into a fully-fledged multiple platform delivery system while maintaining a minimal human footprint and costs (1383 employees as of 2019). 

* Some of Sofi's competitors in their space are, alphabetically (https://craft.co/sofi/competitors)
    * Affirm (https://www.affirm.com/), San Francisco, CA.
    * Avant (https://www.avant.com/), Chicago, IL.
    * CommonBond (https://commonbond.co/), New York, NY.
    * Kabbage (https://www.kabbage.com/), Atlanta, GA.
    * Lending Club (https://www.lendingclub.com/), San Francisco, CA.
    * Upstart Network (https://www.upstart.com/), San Mateo, CA.
    * LendingTree (https://www.lendingtree.com/), Charlotte, NC.


## Results

* Sofi's loan portfolio has grown from $500 million in 2014 to $30 billion as of 2018, and it is a leader in the area of student loan refinancing. From the original 100 student borrowers of the 2011 pilot program at Stanford University, Sofi's had more than 500k borrowers as of 2018 (https://craft.co/sofi). 
* Sofi's market valuation of $4.3 billion is slightly higher than LendingTree's $4.2 billion.
* Within its ecosystem, Sofi is a leader in Twitter followers (+97k) which is 3x larger that than of its closest competitor in that space. Sofi ranks 1st in average monthly tweets, 1st in average monthly "likes" per tweet and 1st in tweet engagements.
* Sofi's Alexa standing is second only to LendingTree's (12,657 vs. 5,758). 
* Since inception, Sofi has raised $2.4 billion, while its nearest competitor CommonBond, which started in 2011 as well has raised $795 million. 
* The only metric where Sofi needs to show improvement is in its employee rating where it is last with a 3.1 along with Avant,  as opposed to the 4.5 rating enjoyed by Upstart Network. 


## Recommendations

* The only recommendation we would have for Sofi would be  to introduce an online banking platform that would tie in all the other business lines and streamline the customer experience as well as provide better internal efficiencies. It will also put it in direct competition with traditional banks with which they should be able to compete. As it happens, Sofi has filed with the Office of he Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for a national banking charter (https://www.businessinsider.com/sofi-reapplies-for-nationwide-banking-license-2020-7, https://www.wsj.com/articles/vc-daily-startup-rivian-raises-2-5-billion-sofi-makes-new-bid-to-start-bank-fewer-vc-funds-but-more-money-11594646894?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=5). That application will also require FDIC approval.

* Once that integration is complete, this company looks very well positioned to go public in the not too distant future.
